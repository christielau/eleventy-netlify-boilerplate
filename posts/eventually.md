## Problem space:
Too many clutter of To-Dos in our camera roll, e.g. event posters.

## How it works:
Eventual.ly is an automated solution for users, extracting information from images. Take a picture of a poster and the event will be created on your calendar with the correct date and time.

## What's next for Eventual.ly:
Seamless sharing with friends
Event managers can monitor poster exposure
Developers can create powerful connections with users via Eventual.ly 
e.g. link to ticket vendors on Songkick via Eventual.ly
