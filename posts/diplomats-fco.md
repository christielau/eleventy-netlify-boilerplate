## The problem to be solved:
A set of regular processes that span across many platforms and channels (online and offline) for both diplomats and back-end staff.

<i class="twa twa-unamused"></i> High operational cost

<i class="twa twa-unamused"></i> Wasting diplomats' time to chase things up

<i class="twa twa-unamused"></i> Error prone and errors are costly

## Challenges
- Absence of APIs for many of the external services
- A number of processes are manual

## Process
- User research with diplomats and back-end staff
- Rapid prototyping with Sketch and Invision
- Iterative sprints of design refinement
- UX writing based on user feedback, documentations and style guides
- Close collaboration with development team to ensure our MVP fits users' context and needs #agile
- Inclusive design and following GDS <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design" target="_blank">service manual</a> standards

## Outcome
- A platform weaving together online and offline processes to guide diplomats through the main task at hand, taking into account the different levels of intergration for each process
- MVP delivery for beta-testers
