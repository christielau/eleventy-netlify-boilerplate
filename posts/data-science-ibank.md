## Client: A leading investment bank

## The problem to be solved:
- Disparate tools and data
- Difficult process to get anything done
- Fear of overspending and exhausting resources

Some stats for you: 
> "The reason data scientists are hired in the first place is to develop algorithms and build machine learning models. Yet 80 percent of a data scientistâ€™s valuable time is spent simply finding, cleaning and reorganizing huge amounts of data."

Too much time spent on finding stuff = Wasting data scientists' time = Wasting money


## Process:
- Stakeholder workshop to understand business needs
- Rapid prototyping with Sketch and Invision
- Data visualisation to draw attention to critical resources
- User research with different user groups
- Close collaboration with development team to create the best solution with design and technical constrains in mind
- Respond to shifting business strategy

## Outcome
MVP delivery for UAT
