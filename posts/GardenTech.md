From the user research we found that the gardening community is reluctant to adopt technology - particularly that might disrupt their approaches to gardening and the sense of community amongst gardeners.

However we also found that far being from being technophobes, a majority of our gardeners (especially the younger ones) were open to the use of technology if it supported their general approach to gardening. Sketches were done on “smart” sensor-meter sticks that measure and shows sunlight, soil moisture and time since planting.
