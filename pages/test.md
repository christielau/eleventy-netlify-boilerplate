            <h2>My story</h2>

            <p>I graduated in BSc Psychology in 2012 and MSc Human-Computer Interaction with Ergonomics in 2015, both at UCL. I worked in different areas in business, from service design to digital marketing between my two degrees. After my master degree, I have led the user-centred design process for 10+ start-ups within my first 12 months working in Rebel Hack Studios. It was great fun helping the best UK startups grow exponentially through optimising conversion rates and end-to-end experiences. </p> 
            
            <p>My empirical psychology background and my experience in business and marketing drive my design process. I conduct user research using qualitative and quantitative methods. Then I provide tested design products and services that address user needs and business KPIs.</p>

            <p>I provide London-based <a href="http://www.clsnaps.cc" target="_blank">photography services</a> too.
