# Hello, I'm Christie! :information_desk_person:

I'm a London-based user experience and service designer with psychology and human-computer interaction background.
Using research insights, I design products and services to address user needs and business objectives.

I'm a Skillshare teacher and my class  <a href="https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc" target="_blank">"How to Create a Storyboard: Bring Your Product/Service Concept to Life in 20 minutes"</a> has won the grand prize in the Skillshare Contest for First Time Business and Technology Teachers. :eyes: <a href="https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc" target="_blank">Watch my class now ></a>

I'll be speaking at General Assembly's event <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/evolving-into-fintech-as-a-uxer-tickets-59760055936" target="_blank">Evolving into Fintech as a UXer</a> on 25th April. See you there! :blush:
