Using qualitative and quantitative research insights, I design products and services to address user needs and business objectives.

I'm a design mentor at Springboard and Skillshare teacher and my class  <a href="https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc" target="_blank">"How to Create a Storyboard: Bring Your Product/Service Concept to Life in 20 minutes"</a> has won the grand prize in the Skillshare Contest for First Time Business and Technology Teachers. <i class="twa twa-eyes"></i>
