# Hello, I'm Christie! :)

I'm a London-based user experience and service designer with psychology and human-computer interaction background.
Using research insights, I design products and services to address user needs and business objectives.

I'm a Skillshare teacher and my class ["How to Create a Storyboard: Bring Your Product/Service Concept to Life in 20 minutes"](https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc) has won the grand prize in the Skillshare Contest for First Time Business and Technology Teachers. 
[Watch my class now >](https://skl.sh/2TOE5Qc)

I will be speaking at General Assembly's event [Evolving into Fintech as a UXer](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/evolving-into-fintech-as-a-uxer-tickets-59760055936) on 24th April. See you there!
