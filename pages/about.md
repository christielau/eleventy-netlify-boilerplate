I graduated in BSc Psychology in 2012 and MSc Human-Computer Interaction with Ergonomics in 2015, both at UCL. I worked in different areas in business, from service design to digital marketing between my two degrees. After my master degree, I have led the user-centred design process for 10+ start-ups within my first 12 months working in Rebel Hack Studios. It was great fun helping the best UK startups grow exponentially through optimising conversion rates and end-to-end experiences.

My empirical psychology background and my experience in business and marketing drive my design process. I conduct user research using qualitative and quantitative methods. Then I provide tested design products and services that address user needs and business KPIs.
