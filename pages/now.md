## My work

Current client: Private banking group of a global tier-1 bank (since February 2020)

I'm designing the alerts and notification system and the onboarding experience of a banking app for high-net-worth individuals. 

Alonside my project, I help raise awareness of design within Capco and run design thinking trainings. Recently I'm writing design blog posts. 

Recently I'm promoted to senior design consultant and I'm grateful for everyone's encouragement and support. <span>&#128522;</span>

## Outside of work
[comment]: # (Outside work, I'm a UX mentor on Springboard and I enjoy meeting with my mentees 1-on-1 each week to provide technical guidance, career advice, and accountability.)

I'm a mentor on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/christie-lau" target="_blank">ADPlist</a> and I enjoy meeting with people who're new to the industry about design and career.If you would like a chat about design career, feel free to get in touch. 

Open to new design opportunities. <span>&#128075;</span>

Recently bought a second-hand Brompton bike <span>&#57654;</span> - getting ready for a healthier post-pandemic lifestyle while reducing our carbon footprint.
