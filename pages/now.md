<small> Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>, this page includes a sample of what I’m thinking about and working on right now. </small>

## Home
I’m very lucky to be able to work from home, with my husband among our houseplants. We're deeply grateful for those who are out there working, delivering, saving lives. Our prayers go to these heroes and the families in need.  

## My work
I'm now working as a design consultant at Capco, a global management consultancy specialised in financial services. 

Currently I'm designing the journeys associated with account lifecycle management for the private banking group at a global bank. Alonside my project, I help raise awareness of design within Capco and run design thinking trainings. I'm providing pro-bono consulting for the Hackney Foodbank.

Outside work, I'm a UX mentor on Springboard and I enjoy meeting with my mentees 1-on-1 each week to provide technical guidance, career advice, and accountability. If you would like a chat about design career, feel free to get in touch.
