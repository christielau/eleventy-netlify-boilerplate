<small> Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>, this page includes a sample of what I’m thinking about and working on right now. </small>

## Home
I’m very lucky to be able to work from home, with my husband among our houseplants. We're deeply grateful for those who are out there working, shipping, delivering. Our prayers go to these heroes and the families in need.  

## My work
I'm a design consultant at Capco, a global management consultancy specialised in financial services. 

Currently I'm designing a content website and its associated management system for the private banking group at a global bank. Alonside my project, I help raise awareness of design within Capco and run design thinking trainings. More recently I'm providing pro-bono consultanting for the Hackney Foodbank.

Outside work, I'm a UX mentor on Springboard and I enjoy meeting with my mentees 1-on-1 each week to provide technical guidance, career advice, and accountability.
