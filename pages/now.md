Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>, this page includes a sample of what I’m thinking about and working on right now. Last updated: 2019-04-17

I'm designing a data-science-in-production platform for a leading European investment bank, to harness the potentials of large-scale data systems in a commercially viable manner. 

I'll be speaking at General Assembly's event <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/evolving-into-fintech-as-a-uxer-tickets-59760055936" target="_blank">Evolving into Fintech as a UXer</a> on 25th April! #savethedate

It's spring now and I"m geminating pea seeds. Something exciting: I started a wormery on my balcony since early March and it is (or should I say they are) doing well.
