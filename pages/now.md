## My work
I'm now working as a senior design consultant at Capco, a global management consultancy specialised in financial services. 

Currently I'm designing the journeys associated with account lifecycle management for the private banking group at a global bank. Alonside my project, I help raise awareness of design within Capco and run design thinking trainings. I'm providing pro-bono consulting for the Hackney Foodbank.


## Outside of work
